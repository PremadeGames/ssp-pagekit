Heise.de's social widget with two way privacy function!

## What does this extension do?
This extension adds three social buttons as a widget.
Facebook/Recommend, Tweet and G+.

The speciality of this extension is, that it uses a 2-click solution.
Social buttons track your behaviour. But with this extension the user
first has to enable the social plugin before it can even be loaded.
